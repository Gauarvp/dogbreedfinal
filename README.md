### 1. Introduction

This manual provides detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and use the Dog Breed Classification system. The system includes features like dog breed classification using machine learning, a marketplace for dog-related products, training videos, a chatbot for assistance, information on pet-friendly places, services for dog walkers and sitters, a QR code system to find lost dogs, and authentication using a local database file. The project will be distributed on a CD-ROM.
